## Welcome to Your Application Development Guide 

> HTMicron has provided comprehensive documentation to guide you through the development process, saving you valuable time.

**Let's get started**

1. **Begin with the Breakout Board**: If you have a breakout board for your application, you can start with the [Breakout board doc](https://github.com/htmicron/htlrbl32l/blob/SDK/Documentation/HTLRBL32L%20Breakout%20Board.pdf).
2. **Flashing the Firmware**: Once your basic connections are in place,  it's time to interact with your device using the [Firmware flashing doc](https://github.com/htmicron/htlrbl32l/blob/SDK/Documentation/Firmware%20Flashing.pdf).
3. **Configuring your devices**: To configure both your end device and gateway, explore the detailed instructions provided in the [Backend Configuration](https://github.com/htmicron/htlrbl32l/blob/SDK/Documentation/Backend%20Configuration.pdf) and [Gateway, network server and application configuration](https://github.com/htmicron/htlrbl32l/blob/SDK/Documentation/Gateway%2C%20Network%20Server%2C%20and%20Application%20Configuration.pdf).
4. **Exploring Applications**:With basic configurations in place, you can choose a example of application from the [Applications folder](https://github.com/htmicron/htlrbl32l/tree/SDK/Examples/Applications). Learn how to clone a project with the easy-to-follow steps outlined in the [Clone a project](https://github.com/htmicron/htlrbl32l/blob/SDK/Documentation/Cloning%20a%20Project.pdf)
